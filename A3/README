How to build the program:
use "make" to build the router
use "make clean" to clean the executable router

How to run the program:
on nse(network state emulator) side: ./nse-linux386 <routers_host> <nse_port>
on router side (run 5 routers in sequence on five windows):
./router <router_id> <nse_host> <nse_port> <router_port>
note: router_id and router_port should be unique for each router and nse_host and nse_port should match the host and port info for nse

Which machine I use to build and test:
nse is run on ubuntu1804-008 and routers are run on ubuntu1804-002

Version of compiler:
gcc 7.4.0
